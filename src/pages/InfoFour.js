          <strong>18 May 2021</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Nearly 13 years ago, in November 2008, I wrote an article with an
          almost identical title for the first edition of the{" "}
          <em>UNECE Transport Review</em> , in which I mentioned that in 1896, a
          pedestrian became the first person ever to be killed by a car driver.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since we are commemorating the 125th anniversary of that first road
          death this year, it is fitting to give some details about this event,
          which this quote from a 14 April 2004 United Nations press release (
          <a href="https://www.un.org/press/en/2004/ga10236.doc.htm">
            GA/10236
          </a>
          ) provides:
        </p>
        <p>
          "LEE JONG-WOOK, Director-General of the World Health Organization
          (WHO), recalled that the first person to be killed by a car had been
          Bridget Driscoll, a 44-year-old mother of two, who was knocked down at
          London’s Crystal Palace on 17 August 1896.&nbsp;The car had been
          travelling at 12 km per hour.&nbsp;Speaking at the inquest, the
          British coroner had warned: 'This must never happen again.'&nbsp; The
          world, to its great loss, had not taken his advice."
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite the coroner’s words, neither the driver nor his employers were
          charged with causing Mrs. Driscoll’s death or committing any other
          offence; the inquest verdict labelled her death “accidental”, in other
          words, brought about by chance or bad luck. We know of no steps that
          were taken for a thorough examination of cause, effect and likely
          remedy that might prevent a similar death from occurring in the
          future.
        </p>
        <p>
          A very dangerous precedent was set all those years ago and the result
          has been a carnage of terrifying proportions, which is still
          continuing day in and day out. While the true figures of people
          killed, maimed and hurt worldwide since 1896 will never be fully
          known, it is estimated that over 50 million have been killed and
          hundreds of millions injured. Heathcote Williams in his poem “
          <a href="https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6g8ddm">Autogeddon</a>”
          refers to this global toll as “the third world war nobody bothered to
          declare”.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today we might liken it to an ongoing pandemic, one that affects
          primarily our vulnerable and our young.
        </p>
        <p>
          A pandemic that, besides the impact of bereavement and injury trauma,
          also has a devastating economic impact. A pandemic that affects low-
          and middle-income countries most of all, is said to cost them more
          than they receive in development assistance<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;and tips
          many families into poverty.<sup>3</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          A pandemic that finally, in 2004—108 years after Bridget Driscoll’s
          death—was placed on the{" "}

          and acknowledged as a major public health issue.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a result, the{" "}

          October 2005, through support from WHO, especially Dr. Etienne Krug.
          The Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011-2020, with its own{" "}

            Global Plan
          </a>
          , was also launched and completed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet to date, there has been little or no progress in reducing the
          annual{" "}
          <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/road-traffic-injuries">
            1.35 million road fatalities (3,700 a day) and 20 to 50 million
            injuries
          </a>
          . Depressingly, no percentage at all of the 50 per cent reduction
          target has been achieved over the past decade. That target was called
          “ambitious”, but to road victims and road victim advocates, only a 0
          per cent target is acceptable—
          <a href="https://visionzeronetwork.org/about/what-is-vision-zero/">
            Vision Zero
          </a>
          —since a 50 per cent target actually means that each year 700,000 road
          deaths and millions of road injuries are expected and planned in,
          something that would be unthinkable for deaths and injuries caused in
          any other way.
        </p>
        <p>
          We greatly welcome the theme of lower speeds—"

          ” for this year’s UN Global Road Safety Week because we know that low
          speeds have the potential to save lives. However, this potential will
          only be achieved if, in addition to promotion, lower speed observance
          is ensured through strict enforcement and meaningful sanctions for
          non-observance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Non-compliance with traffic rules is the principal cause of road
          deaths and injuries; therefore, a serious investigation of fatal and
          injury crashes to identify the main causation factors, followed by
          legal actions if appropriate, should form a crucial part of road
          casualty prevention work. Yet amazingly, it doesn’t, which is likely
          to be the very reason for the unrelenting scale.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the last Global Road Safety Plan, FEVR, as a member of UNRSC,
          lobbied successfully for Activity 5 to be added to Pillar 5—post-crash
          response: “Encourage a thorough investigation into the crash and the
          application of an effective legal response to road deaths and injuries
          and therefore encourage fair settlements and justice for the bereaved
          and injuries”.<sup>4</sup> Unfortunately, it seems that Activity 5 has
          yet to become <em>active</em> worldwide.
        </p>
        <p>
          Enforcement, investigation and legal response ought to become an
          integral part of road crash prevention work to finally achieve a shift
          from the current unacceptable carnage. They need to be part of
          “post-crash response” in the new Global Plan and to be put into
          practice.

          <strong>Non-governmental organization “Brussels Declaration”</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          For the first Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011–2020,
          non-governmental organizations (NGOs) advocating for road victims and
          road danger reduction compiled 33 recommendations to governments in

          .
        </p>
        <p>
          The Declaration was signed by 70 NGOs from 40 countries, who came
          together in Brussels in May 2009, 12 years ago, at a meeting hosted by
          WHO, and who subsequently, over the course of six months, sent their
          proposals, comments and agreement to the recommendations in five main
          areas: general approach; prevention; post-crash response; worldwide
          learning; and joint initiatives and actions.
          <br />
          <br />
          Of the 70 NGOs, 12 were FEVR member organizations, the others
          individual NGOs from all continents. Many of the latter are now
          affiliated to the subsequently set up{" "}

            Re-launch of NGO recommendations for Decade 2021-2030{" "}
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          These important recommendations have yet to be realized, therefore
          deserve and require a re-launch for the coming decade—with an appeal
          that they <em>will </em>be put into action.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Summary of NGO recommendations for the ‘Decade of Action’
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Advocacy NGOs representing road victims and road users have a
          particular interest in an improved road safety situation, indeed a
          fatality-free global road transport network. Many such NGOs were set
          up by people who have suffered bereavement or injury through a road
          crash and were motivated by their personal suffering to help other
          victims or engage in road safety activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          In May 2009, more than 100 representatives of 70 NGOs from 40
          countries came together for the first time in Brussels at a meeting
          hosted by WHO. Using their unique expertise and perspective,
          participants compiled 33 recommendations to improve road safety in
          five subject areas. Below is a summary of their key recommendations to
          Governments.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <u>
            <strong>GENERAL APPROACH</strong>
          </u>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            The road is a public domain as well as a network to link people.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Therefore, NGOs call on Governments to:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            change transportation policy drastically, giving top priority to
            safety and sustainable mobility
          </li>
          <li>
            address traffic-danger related injuries and mobility as a public
            health and human rights issues
          </li>
          <li>
            design roads taking account of the role of the public space and
            rights/needs of vulnerable road users
          </li>
          <li>
            Avoid use of the word "accident" to the extent possible as it
            implies an event which happens without apparent cause
          </li>
        </ul>

        <br />
        <p>
          <u>
            <strong>PREVENTION</strong>
          </u>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            It is our duty to reduce road casualties to as close to zero as
            possible.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Therefore, NGOs ask Governments to:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>lead by example in managing risks</li>
          <li>
            provide resources for research and strict enforcement and reform of
            traffic laws
          </li>
          <li>establish a sustainable financing mechanism for road safety</li>
          <li>
            adopt global standards for traffic police training, driver training
            and licensing
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          <u>
            <strong>WORLDWIDE LEARNING</strong>
          </u>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            It is essential to return to sustainable mobility modes in the face
            of the enormous cost in human lives and the effect of pollution on
            climate change.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Therefore, NGOs ask that Governments pay particular attention to:
          </strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            accommodating and integrating all different modes of mobility in the
            design of all roads
          </li>
          <li>providing safety and comfort for vulnerable road users</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          <u>
            <strong>JOINT INITIATIVES AND ACTIONS</strong>
          </u>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            NGOs offer Governments their cooperation, expertise and joint
            initiatives, in return for partnership, secure funding, and support
            for their work.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The NGOs propose:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            national advocacy networks – to ensure nationwide advocacy for road
            safety and road victims
          </li>
          <li>
            joint observance of the World Day of Remembrance, a Day initiated by
            victims, as an opportunity for highlighting the consequences of road
            danger and impact of road death and injury
          </li>
          <li>
            establishment of a national memorial to road victims in the capital
            city of every country
          </li>
          <li>
            establishment of an International Coalition Against Road Trauma
            (ICART), made up of national Coalitions Against Road Trauma
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          May the 125th anniversary year of Bridget Driscoll’s death, with the
          launch of the Sixth UN Global Road Safety Week (and the new{" "}

          ), become the turning point in the casual treatment of culpable road
          deaths and injuries, and with it lead to their eventual elimination.
        </p>
        <p>
          And may the widest possible observance of the World Day of Remembrance
          help achieve this with its spotlight on the profound consequences of
          road danger, i.e. the impact of traumatic bereavement and injury and
          its high cost to families, communities and countries.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reducing the toll will represent the best support and recognition for
          road victims everywhere.
